**Post sharing app with registration**

## About project

    This is a simple PHP MVC project that I made as a learning project from scratch.
    Working user registration, login/logout functionality, Password encryption, form input validation.
    Project has MVC structure with CRUD operations where you can create, read, update and delete posts.
    
## How to use

    To run this project locally you will need local web server. I use XAMPP, but there are different software stacks that you can use (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apache%E2%80%93MySQL%E2%80%93PHP_packages)
    Open XAMPP, start your Apache and MySQL modules.
    Open phpmyadmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin/).
    Create database named 'shareposts', or you can choose whatever name you want, but then you will have to change app/config/config.php file.
    Select your database and import shareposts.sql file found in app/sqlData/shareposts.sql
    Now you can access the site trought your localhost connection.
